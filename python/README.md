# PyAscend -- Python from Zero to Mastery

A structured, hands-on curriculum that takes you from absolute beginner to advanced Python developer. Every chapter focuses on core language features -- no web frameworks, no data-science libraries, no ML toolkits. Just Python itself, understood deeply.

## Prerequisites

- A computer (Linux, macOS, or Windows)
- Python 3.10 or later (`python3 --version` to check)

## How to Use

Each chapter lives in its own directory and contains:

- `README.md` -- concepts and explanations
- `exercises/` -- problems to solve (files have `TODO` comments where you write code)
- `solutions/` -- reference implementations

Run any exercise or solution directly:

```bash
python3 python/01_basics/exercises/ex01_hello.py
```

Compare your work against the solution when you are done. The projects follow the same structure but combine skills from multiple chapters.
